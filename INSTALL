Basic Installation
==================

CMake is designed for the build process to be done in a separate
directory. The simplest way to compile is:

  1. `cd' into the extracted directory.

  2. `git clone git@github.com:gottcode/xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin.git external/xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin`

  3. `cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr' to create a location
     for the sources and then configure the sources. There are more options
     you can pass to cmake, see below for details.

  4. `cmake --build build' to compile. This will also rerun
     cmake for you if any CMakeLists.txt files have changed.

  5. `cmake --install build' to install the application. This has to be done
     with root privileges if installing to system directories, but the
     rest of the build should be done with regular user privileges.

     For packaging you can optionally install the plugin into a temporary
     directory by setting the DESTDIR environment variable. For example,
     `DESTDIR="alternate/directory" cmake --install build' will prepend
     'alternate/directory' before all installation names.

Uninstallation
==============

  1. `cmake --build build --target uninstall' to remove the installed
     files. Note that if you provided a DESTDIR variable when installing,
     be sure to provide the same variable. The DESTDIR variable must be
     an absolute path when uninstalling.

Debug Builds
============

You should create different directories for each type of build:

  1. `cmake -B debug -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' to configure the sources.

  2. `cmake --build debug' to compile the plugin.

More CMake Options
==================

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>
    Choose the type of build. Possible values are:
      'None' 'Debug' 'Release' 'RelWithDebInfo' 'MinSizeRel'

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>
    Choose the base location where the plugin is installed
    (defaults to /usr/local).

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR=<path>
    Choose where binaries are installed
    (defaults to $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin).

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=<path>
    Choose where libraries are installed
    (defaults to $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib).

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR=<path>
    Choose where the data files are installed
    (defaults to $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share).

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LOCALEDIR=<path>
    Choose where the localization files are installed
    (defaults to $CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR/locale).

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_MANDIR=<path>
    Choose where manual pages are installed
    (defaults to $CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR/man).

-DENABLE_ACCOUNTSSERVICE=[ON]
    Check for the AccountsService library.

-DENABLE_VISIBILITY=[ON]
    Make compiler hide local symbols in plugin.

-DENABLE_AS_NEEDED=[ON]
    Pass -Wl,--as-needed to the linker to reduce symbols in plugin.

-DENABLE_LINKER_OPTIMIZED_HASH_TABLES=[ON]
    Pass -Wl,-O1 to the linker to optimize hash tables in plugin.

-DENABLE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION=[ON]
    Reduce size by optimizing entire plugin at link time.
    (on by default in 'Release', 'RelWithDebInfo', 'MinSizeRel').

-DENABLE_STRIP=[ON]
    Reduce size by removing symbols.
    (on by default in 'Release', 'MinSizeRel').

-DENABLE_DEVELOPER_MODE=[OFF]
    Enable strict checks which are not needed by users of the plugin
    but are useful for development.
