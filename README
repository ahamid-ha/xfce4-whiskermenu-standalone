This is a hack for Whisker Menu to run as a standalone application. So it can be used
with panels other than xfce panel.

Whisker Menu is an application launcher for Xfce. It is an xfce4 panel plugin, so
it can't work without xfce panel running.

How to use?
===========
Just run `whiskermenu_standalone`. Currently it doesn't understand any arguments and
will just open in the current mouse position. The opplication will terminate when the
applications window is closed.

Installation
============
You need to compile it using the steps in [INSTALL](./INSTALL)
